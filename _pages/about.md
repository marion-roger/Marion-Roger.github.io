I am a recent PhD graduate in Earth Sciences from the University of Grenoble Alpes. My PhD thesis focused on quantifying sediment fluxes from the Carpathian belt to the foreland basin during foreland development. I compiled and analyzed data such as thermochronological ages, field observations and geological maps and sections to produce a meta-analysis of the Carpathian system. I am trying to correlate observations on different spheres, from surface to asthenosphere, to understand the development of retreating subduction zones.
