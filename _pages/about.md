I am a freshly graduate Doctor in Earth Sciences from the University of Grenoble Alpes. My PhD thesis revolved around the quantification of sediment fluxes from the Carpathian belt to the foreland basin during foreland development. I compiled and analysed data such as thermochronological ages, field observations and geological maps and sections to make a meta-analysis of the Carpathian system. I try to corrrelate observations on different spheres, from surface to the asthenosphere, to understand the development of the Carpathian foreland basin during the lateral detachment of the slab.
