I recently completed my PhD in Earth Sciences at the University of Grenoble Alpes. My research focused on quantifying sediment fluxes from the Carpathian belt to the foreland basin during foreland development. Utilizing various datasets including thermochronological ages, geological observations, and meta-analysis of the Carpathian system, I aimed to understand the intricate dynamics of retreating subduction zones.<br>
My research pursuits aim to connect observations across various geological spheres, spanning from surface-level studies to asthenospheric dynamics. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying the evolution of retreating subduction zones.
