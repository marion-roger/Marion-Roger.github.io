The Carpathian Belt and Foreland Basin, shaped by the retreat of the European slab in the Neogene era, stand out in the context of the Alpine orogeny. These regions offer an exclusive research landscape unaffected by other active geological features, providing a unique opportunity for in-depth sediment analysis and volumetric study.

I'll be walking you through the key aspects of my thesis project undertaken between 2019 and 2023, focused on exploring the geological intricacies of these areas.

My project revolved around quantifying sediment pathways within the Carpathian systemâ€”both eroded from the belt and preserved in the foreland basin. This undertaking was structured into three key sub-objectives:
<ul>
    <li>- retrace the exhumation history of the Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt</li>
    <li>- quantifying sediment volumes in the foreland basin per stratigraphic unit</li>
    <li>- draw a volumetric and source-to-sink analysis of the system, and relate it to its geological context</li>
</ul>

    The initial phase involved compiling a comprehensive low-temperature thermochronology database specifically for the Carpathian belt. We conducted fieldwork in the Ukrainian Carpathians, collecting samples for ZHe, AFT, and AHe dating.
The outcomes of this expedition are detailed in my article available here:  <a href="https://se.copernicus.org/articles/14/153/2023/">Access article</a>

The subsequent phases of this project are currently unpublished. Thus, the following images showcase our field campaign in Ukraine, a stunning location.
