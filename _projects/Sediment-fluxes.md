The Carpathian Belt and Foreland Basin, shaped by the retreat of the European slab in the Neogene era, stand out in the context of the Alpine orogeny. These regions offer an exclusive research landscape unaffected by other active geological features, providing a unique opportunity for in-depth sediment analysis and volumetric study.

I'll be walking you through the key aspects of my thesis project undertaken between 2019 and 2023, focused on exploring the geological intricacies of these areas.

My project implicated the aspect of quantyfing sediments from the Carpathian systeme,i.e., the sediment eroded from the belt and the sediment preserved in the foreland basin.
The project divided itself into three sub-objectivies:
<ul>
    <li>- retrace the exhumation history of the Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt</li>
    <li>- quantifying sediment volumes in the foreland basin per stratigraphic unit</li>
    <li>- draw a volumetric and source-to-sink analysis of the system, and relate it to its geological context</li>
</ul>

    The first step requiered a completion of the low-temperature thermocrhonology database I built for the Carpathian belt. We went to the Ukrainian Carpathian and sampled for ZHe, AFT, and AHe dating.
    The results of this campaigne are available in my article here:  <a href="https://se.copernicus.org/articles/14/153/2023/">Access article</a>

The other steps of this project have yet to be published, therefore the following images are from the field campagne in Ukraine, a very beautifull place.
